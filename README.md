## Hi there, I'm Okihita 👋

I'm a hands-on tech lead, specializing in Android application development and able to switch to fullstack when needed. I've led teams to build and deliver large-scale Android super-apps in education and banking.

I'm especially interested in:
* Building magical mobile experiences for users 📱
* Scaling systems up 🚀
* Shipping reliable apps ✅

To foster a healthy working environment, I cheer, motivate, and share tips with peers for higher productivity, team cohesion, and job satisfaction.
